# Sisyphus Table
---------------

This is for a project to create a "Sisyphus Table," a table covered in sand 
with a hidden mechanism underneath that draws a ball bearing through the sand 
on top, to create patterns in the sand. This project contains code to run an 
Arduino to drive the mechanism, as well as graphics files to plot, code to give a visual 
preview of the patterns that will be drawn, code to generate toolpaths in the
style of "spirographs," and code to generate toolpaths from vector images.
