# Sisyphus
---------------

This is for a project to create a "Sisyphus Table," a table covered in sand 
with a hidden mechanism that draws a ball bearing through the sand on top to 
create patterns. This project contains code to run an Arduino to drive the 
mechanism, as well as graphic files to plot, code to give a visual 
preview of the patterns that will be drawn, code to generate toolpaths in the
style of "spirographs," and code to generate toolpaths from vector images.
